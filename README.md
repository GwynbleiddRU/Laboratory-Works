# Student Laboratory Works Repository
This repository contains laboratory works completed by first-year students of "Program Engineering" (2018-19) at Higher School of Economics university. Each project has its own folder with the source code and description.

## Overall description of what's inside
1. Windows Application for Simple Database Management
This project is a Windows application that manages a simple database containing monthly income data for the departments of the "Phoenix" company for five years. The application allows users to add, delete, modify, and view records in the file. It also calculates the average income of each department over five years and determines the longest period for each department with an income below the overall company average.

2. Class Hierarchy and Virtual Functions
This project involves creating a hierarchy of classes representing different types of states, such as republics, monarchies, kingdoms, and states. The objects of these classes are then stored in an array, and the program displays the contents of the array. The project also demonstrates the use of virtual functions.

3. Hierarchical Class Sorting and Searching
This project involves creating a class hierarchy containing at least one interface and one abstract class. The program then creates an array of interface elements and adds instances of various classes to the array. The program sorts the array elements using standard interfaces and Array class methods and searches for an element in the array.

4. Inheritance and Collections
This project involves creating a class hierarchy with a base and a derived class. The derived class should have a property that returns a reference to the object of the base class. The program then creates four collections containing the same number of elements, and each element in the first collection corresponds to an element in the second collection. The program then measures the time it takes to search for four different elements: the first, the central, the last, and an element not in the collection.
